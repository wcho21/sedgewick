**Data structures** go hand in hand with **algorithms**, so try to consider the both whenever learning one of them.

An **array** is a fundamental data structure, and usually built-in in many programming languages.
On the other hand, a **linked list** is also fundamental, but usually not built-in since it requires memory management.

A **stack** can be implemented using either an array or a linked list.
Note that the same data structure can be implemented by different data structures.
The client programmer should not need to know the implementation details, so usually only the ADT (abstract data type) is provided in the documentation.
If the stack is implemented with an array, consider making the array resizable rather than fixed.
